# mkdocs

- Using docker I deployed an mkdocs app. mkdocs is __
- I then stored this into github into my github.io git pages repo. 
- After some long research and trial and error, I was finally able to give my git pages the theme 'readthedocs' - this was the theme that the mkdocs had when it was deployed on my local machine. 
- Here is what it looked like before (screens).
- And here is what it looks like now (screens). It looks more like documentation pages which is the intention.
- I will be using mkdocs on git pages to document my progress on several technologies that I'm learning and trying out.
