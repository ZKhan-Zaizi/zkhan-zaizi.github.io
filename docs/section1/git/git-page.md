# Github

Project 1 of the Grad program is to learn Git. 

- I Created a github account. The github profile can be visited at [gitsugatensho](github.com/gitsugatensho)
- I secured my account by adding 2 factor authentification. 
- To connect to git via the terminal I had to set up SSH keys and link them to my Github account. This allowed for remote access to my account from my local terminal. 
- I also set up GPG keys and linked my Github account accordingly. (insert some screens)

- Next I made my first repo. I added an empty .txt file and then using the terminal, I cloned the repo into a folder on my local machine. I created a new branch (insert screens) and edited the empty text file to say "I hope this goes to the split branch". I pushed this file into the branch, and upon inspection it was there, in the new branch.
- I wanted to create a pull request to merch this new branch into the main/master branch. After running the right commands, I had successfully merged the new branch into the main branch. (insert screeens)

- I learnt about protection of master branches - for best practice, no one should alter the main branch, and merge requests from other branches need to be verified before merging. 

- I then forked a project I found on github. It was a repo full of many different python projects. I decided to commit a change to a project called 'music player'. I forked the repo, and then changed a python file to have the title of the music file that was playing to be aligned in the center of the gui instead of aligned left. I pushed this code but into my forked repo.

- I then took some time to understand what git diff, git status, and git log do. 

- I also learnt what a .gitignore file was and made one to ignore a whole folder.

- I created several README.md files for some other repos I had created. 

- I studied git conflicts and learnt how they can be a problem in larger teams.
